Most software that you use is a combination of a client software system and a server software system. "The cloud" is a generic term for a group of servers that do the same thing.

For example:
- You use the TikTok app on your phone, which performs searches and recommends videos in the cloud.
- You play a multiplayer game on your XBox, but a server controls people entering and leaving, tracking scores, and managing lag.
- You have used `pip` to install Python libraries, but `pip` talks to a remote server to find the package and retrieve the bytes.

In the final weeks of SENG 201, we will connect to a remote server to host a network application. You will edit and deploy the application.
