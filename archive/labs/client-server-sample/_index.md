description: Starting up a template web application and communicating with it programmatically

## Intro
In the [previous lab](../working-on-ada/), we connected to the `ada` server and used it's CLI to create folders.  

I also asked you to browse to <http://152.20.12.250:23456/> to connect to a web application written in Python. You must be on a UNCW network or the VPN to connect, and it's possible the app isn't running.

## Goals
The goal of this lab is to create a web app server, which is a copy of the one above. You will then interact with it through two clients: (1) your web browser, and (2) a simple Python client.
