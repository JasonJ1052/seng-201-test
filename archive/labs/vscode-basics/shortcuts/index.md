## Keyboard shortcuts
Everything you can do with a menu and a mouse has a keyboard shortcut. Menu+mouse is easier to learn, but keyboard shortcuts will make you about 30% more productive once you master them.

**Rule of thumb:** If you use the same mouse+menu commands over and over, learn the keyboard shortcut instead. Try to learn a shortcut or two each week.

I've <mark>highlighted</mark> my most-used keyboard shortcuts in the official cheatsheets from VSCode:
- [Cheatsheet for Mac](keyboard-shortcuts-macOS.pdf)
- [Cheatsheet for Windows](keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) if using WSL.
- [Cheatsheet for Linux](keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf) if using VirtualBox.

When you see, e.g., `Ctrl+X`, that means hold down the Control key and then press X.
