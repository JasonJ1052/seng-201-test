## Instructions
1. Clone the project to your `seng-201/` directory or wherever you are gathering your assignments.
2. **Option 1**: Create some content for your project. I don't care what it is: Python files, text files, etc.  Make ***at least two, small, incremental commits*** to the `main` branch that change your project content.
3. **Option 2**: Complete Assignment 4 using this repo instead of creating your own.
4. `git push` your completed code.

## Rubric
No partial credit.
- (10 pts) Your remote repo's version history show that you contributes a minimum of two versions on the `main` branch.

## Submission due November 11
Push your version to GitHub by the deadline. No Canvas submission.
