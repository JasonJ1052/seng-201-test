<mark>You are responsible for knowing **all** the CLI commands in this lab.</mark>

By the end of the lab, you should be able to navigate your OS's file system, manage files and directories, manipulate text files, and utilize process management commands.

### Pro tips before you get started
1. <mark>**Mega important:**</mark>There is no notion of "undo", a "trash can", or a "recycle bin" in the CLI. You run a command, it's done. So you have to be careful when you do things like delete or move files in the CLI. 
2. Press the `Tab` key to autocomplete the command or filename you are typing. Big time saver.
3. Use the `up arrow` on your keyboard to cycle through the most-recently used commands you typed in. Good for re-running things.
4. Program going crazy and the CLI is not responding? Stuck typing and can't get out? Press `Control+C` or `Command+C`. This sends a signal to the OS to kill the running process.
