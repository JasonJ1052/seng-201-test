## Launching a terminal on Mac

The terminal program on Macs is simply called "Terminal". You can open it in two ways:
1. Finder &rarr; Applications &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Terminal
2. Press Command+Spacebar. Type "terminal" in the Spotlight Search popup and you will see an option to open the Terminal. 
   1. CMD+Spacebar is a great way to open apps quickly on Mac.
   2. You may wish to drag the Terminal application to your Dock at the bottom.

## Windows

Windows has several terminal programs. Windows PowerShell and Command Prompt are for interacting with Windows CLI directly. We want to open an Ubuntu terminal for interacting with the Ubuntu OS you installed in the previous lab.

1. Open the Windows menu and search for "Terminal"
2. It will most likely open a window like this:

This is PowerShell. The rest of the CLI labs assume you are using PowerShell on Windows as it allows for more *nix style comamnds than the old-school Command Prompt.

3. Click the dropdown to the PowerShell tab. You should see an option for Ubuntu. Select it. After a moment, you should see the Ubuntu Terminal that looks like this:

### Using VirtualBox

1. Open VirtualBox and start your Ubuntu virtual machine.
2. Once Ubuntu opens, click the "More Apps" icon and find the Terminal.
3. Alternately, press the Windows key (called the *super* key in Ubuntu) and start typing "Terminal" and you will see it suggested. 
   - The Windows key and typing a search term is a great way to find things in Ubuntu and usually faster than clicking through a menu.
