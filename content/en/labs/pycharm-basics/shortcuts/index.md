## Keyboard shortcuts
Everything you can do with a menu and a mouse has a keyboard shortcut. Menu+mouse is easier to learn, but keyboard shortcuts will make you about 30% more productive once you master them.

**Rule of thumb:** If you use the same mouse+menu commands over and over, learn the keyboard shortcut instead. Try to learn a shortcut or two each week.

I've <mark>highlighted</mark> my most-used keyboard shortcuts in the official cheatsheets from PyCharm:
- [Cheatsheet for Windows or Linux](PyCharm_ReferenceCard.pdf).
- [Cheatsheet for Mac](PyCharm_ReferenceCard_mac.pdf).
