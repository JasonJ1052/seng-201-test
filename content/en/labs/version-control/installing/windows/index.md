These instructions are to set up Git on a personal Windows computer.

1. Download `64-bit Git for Windows Setup` from <https://git-scm.com/downloads/win>
1. Run the installer. You will keep the default options, **except for the following:**
  - On the **Choosing the default editor for Git** screen, I recommend that you pick an editor that you are somewhat familiar with, like Notepad.
    {{< figure src="win-default-editor.png" >}}
  - On the **Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories** screen, select the bottom option:
    {{< figure src="win-main.png" >}}


Leave the remaining options set to their defaults. When done, return to the Git Configuration section in the [Git install lab](../_index.md#git-configuration).
