***Remote repositories*** in Git are repositories stored elsewhere than on your computer, usually on a site like GitHub or a private enterprise server for your company. Remote repositories have a few key purposes:
1. Remote repositories are the mechanism by versions can be shared between computers, e.g., between a lab and home computer or between the computers of multiple teammates collaborating on code.
2. Remote repos maintain a copy of your version control history so that if disaster strikes your computer, you have a backup of your project.

Remote repositories are a hub to which multiple local repositories are linked. They function the same as a local repo, but the user takes extra steps to share changes with the remote and to retrieve changes, perhaps made by teammates, from the remote.
