For all of the following, write both the function and some code that calls and tests the function.

<mark>Complete the following without using ANY outside aid.</mark> If necessary, refer only to the python `help()` command or the official documentation at <https://python.org>.

Use your preferred programming environment (IDLE, Pycharm, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

1. Write a function with two parameters: a string and an integer `n`. *Using a for loop*, print the string `n` times.
1. Write a function with one parameter: a list. Print each element of the list *using a for loop*.
1. Write a function with two parameters: a list and a `target`. *Using a for loop*, count the number of times `target` appears in the list and print the total.
1. Write a function with two parameters: a list and a `target`. *Using a while or for loop*, print the first *index* in the list where `target` appears. Print `not present` if it does not exist in the list.
1. Write a function with one parameter: a list of integers. *Using a loop*, count the number of even and odd integers in the list. Print the total count of evens and odds.

## <mark>Solutions</mark>
There are a few ways to solve each problem. Here are a few: [week2-soln.py](./jhad61egd/week2-soln.py)

## Submission
Submit your `.py` file to Canvas for a check. You are not graded on completeness or correctness -- this is for learning and feedback.

## Key Skills
- Function definition with parameters.
- Function calling.
- Selection using `if-else`.
- Iteration using a `for` loop and working with the list `index`.
- Combining iteration and selection.
