## Format and Rules
- The quiz is **in class**, Thursday, Oct 30.
- A mix of multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and long answer questions.
- You will not be programming in PyCharm, but you may be asked to write or edit code snippets by hand.
- You may bring ***1 side of 1 sheet of letter paper*** with your own ***hand-written*** notes. No other resources are permitted.
- An Honor Code violation on the any quiz or exam result in a course grade of F.
- Failure to submit a quiz or exam results in a course grade of F.

## Content
- Study ***key terms*** from slides and labs. Look for <u><b>boldfaced, underlined terms</b></u> in slides and ***emphasized terms*** in labs.
- Study ***Knowledge Checks*** from labs.
- Code Conventions and Documentation: Week 7 on [Canvas](https://uncw.instructure.com/courses/99267/modules/603266) + [Labs](../../labs/style-and-documentation/).
   - Write a valid Python docstring for a provided function including the essential elements: description, parameters, return values, and exceptions. Syntax need not be perfect but needs to be very close.
   - Identify and correct violations of PEP8 coding conventions in provided Python code. Emphasis will be on naming conventions and whitespace within lines.
   - Given a Python function, be prepared to add type hints to function parameters and return values.
- Filling in the blanks on a visual diagram [like this one](../../labs/version-control/git-branching/feature-1-v3-repo.jpg) showing the state of Git repos (a) after running a set of Git commands, or (b) based on `git log` output.
- Provide the appropriate `git` command or sequence of commands for common scenarios, including:
    - creating a new local repository
    - creating a new version
    - viewing the status of a branch
    - viewing the history of a branch
    - staging changes
    - creating a new branch
    - merging one branch into another
    - sending and retrieving changes from the remote repository
- Explain whether or not a merge conflict would occur given a scenario.
- Demonstrate how to resolve merge conflicts while preserving functionality.
- The following topics from earlier in the semester are also on the table:
   - Testing concepts (terms) and application (weeks 4-6), including:
      - Writing or analyzing [unit tests](../../labs/testing/) for a given function
      - Writing `assert` statements
      - Testing if exceptions are raised using `pytest` functions
